Data and code for "The spillover of floral fungi across ecological boundaries" Nelson, Bergmann, Jochim and Valdovinos 2026

The raw amplicon sequencing data are available on the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under Bioproject ID PRJNA1424457. Such data can be then downloaded for use in the bioinformatic processing scripts.

Project objective: In this study, native wildflowers (clover, goldfields, vetch) were sampled at different sites throughout the UC McLauglin Natural Reserve. We examine whether the following three ecological hypotheses explain floral fungal diversity: (H1) species sorting and environmental filtering when fungal relative abundances differ by plant species, (H2) diversity begets fungal diversity, and (H3) fungal spillover across serpentine - non-serpentine habitat boundaries.
